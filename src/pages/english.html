                For all our students wishing to take driving lessons in English, Anthony will be your
                instructor.
                We have been collaborating since the opening of the Pit lane driving school, and we
                studied together
                at the driving instructor school. Anthony has an excellent teaching approach and will
                perfectly meet
                your needs in English. Trust him; he will take great care of you!
